# Global Ads Performance Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes global advertising performance data to understand platform effectiveness, ad spend efficiency, and revenue trends. The analysis was performed using Python in Google Colab and focuses on key metrics such as impressions, clicks, CTR, CPC, CPA, ad spend, revenue, and ROAS.

## Dataset
- **Name:** Global Ads Performance Dataset  
- **Source:** Public dataset (CSV)  
- **Description:** Contains advertising performance metrics across multiple platforms, campaigns, industries, and countries.

## Tools & Libraries
- Python  
- Pandas (data manipulation)  
- Matplotlib & Seaborn (visualization)  
- Google Colab (execution environment)

## Analysis & Insights
- **Average CTR by Platform:** Shows differences in user engagement across platforms. Platforms with higher CTR indicate stronger interaction, while lower CTR platforms may need optimization.  
- **Revenue Over Time:** Revenue trends fluctuate over time, highlighting the impact of campaign timing, budget allocation, and seasonal effects.  
- **Additional Metrics:** Further analysis includes CPC, CPA, ROAS, and platform/country-wise performance evaluation.

## Key Findings
- The dataset is clean with no missing or duplicate values.  
- Ad spend positively correlates with revenue, indicating effective investment.  
- Platforms vary in performance; targeting high CTR/ROAS platforms can improve efficiency.  
- Time-based analysis helps identify high-performing periods for better campaign planning.

## How to Run
1. Open the notebook in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).  
2. Upload the CSV dataset or connect your Google Drive.  
3. Run cells sequentially to explore data, visualize metrics, and see insights.  

## Future Improvements
- Perform deeper country-level and campaign-level analysis.  
- Explore predictive modeling for revenue forecasting.  
- Automate ROI optimization recommendations for platforms.
